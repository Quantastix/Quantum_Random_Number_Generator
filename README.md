Computers are logical machines. This makes them efficient for performing tasks where instructions (codes) and rules have to be followed rigorously and repetitively. This attribute makes them inefficient at performing operations where we seek randomness rather than following instructions.

You cannot code randomness. It means classical computers are ill-suited to generating a perfect set of “random” numbers and is a limitation of classical computers.

Classical computers can generate pseudo-random numbers that come close to being random but are not perfectly random. Pseudo-random number generators (PRNG) are based on mathematical algorithms that need a starting seed state. This seed state can then be used to quickly generate a set of random numbers. These numbers are not truly random as they are deterministic. Why?
